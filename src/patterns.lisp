;;; A pattern ξ is an element of a pattern language L. A pattern ξ acts as a
;;; binder in the calculus. A pattern can bind name variables, of the form (a),
;;; where a ∈ N, and process variables. All name and process variables appearing
;;; in a pattern ξ are bound by the pattern. Name variables can only match
;;; names. Process variables can only match processes. Patterns are supposed to
;;; be linear with respect to process variables, that is, each process variable
;;; x occurs only once in a given pattern ξ.
;;;
;;; We make the following assumptions on a pattern language L:
;;; – A pattern language L is a set of patterns that are multisets of single
;;;   patterns ξm, ξd, ξu, and ξk. The language L can be described by a
;;;   grammar, with the multiset union being represented by parallel
;;;   composition.
;;;   • ξm is taken from the set Ξm and is a local message pattern: it is used
;;;     to match local messages;
;;;   • ξd is taken from the set Ξd and is a down message pattern: it is used
;;;     to match messages from immediate subkells;
;;;   • ξu is taken from the set Ξu and is a up message pattern: it is used to
;;;     match messages from the environment of the enclosing kell;
;;;   • ξk is taken from the set Ξk and is a kell message pattern: it is used
;;;     to match immediate subkells.
